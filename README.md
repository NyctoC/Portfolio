🚀 Cristian’s Portfolio
-----------------------

This is my personal **developer portfolio**, built entirely with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** - no frameworks, no libraries, just clean and optimized code. The design embraces a **modern, space-inspired aesthetic**, combining smooth animations, interactive elements, and a fully responsive layout.

### **🌌 Features**

*   **Custom Animated Intro:** A dynamic landing section with a floating **starfield** and a smooth **rocket animation**.
*   **Floating UI Elements:** Subtle **glassmorphism** effects and a soft **floating animation** that enhances the futuristic feel.
*   **Tech Stack Carousel:** A **tech stack section** displaying my expertise in Unity3D, Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, React, and more.
*   **Dark Theme Aesthetic:** A sleek **dark mode** interface with a carefully chosen color palette for readability and contrast.
*   **Smooth Transitions & Animations:** Every interaction is polished with CSS animations for a seamless experience.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The portfolio adapts perfectly to any device, from desktops to mobile screens.

### **🎯 Why This Approach?**

I wanted to challenge myself by **avoiding libraries** and frameworks, proving that **pure web technologies** can still deliver a stunning, high-performance user experience.
